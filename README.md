# Authentication in Microservices

	In this Project , we can able to login using jwt token in different services without even creating session or without network calls , managing the tokens in such a way that we dont have to store crendentials or token in DB or not even create session in server , so user will get the response in no time. 


### Key Feature
	when using microservices , main thing we have to care of is "Security", So we have to implement token so security have not to be broken. By maintaining the refresh tokens in such a way that user will not face any security breakage issues
